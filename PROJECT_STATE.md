# PROJECT_STATE.md - Researka v2

## Current Sprint
Week of: 2026-04-21
Focus: Phase 1 — internal AAA + safe invited pilot. 8-phase execution plan.

## Goal
Build a clean Python runtime that can replace the current hot-path publishing logic without dragging frontend or legacy product baggage into the rebuild.

## Phase 1 Progress
- [x] Repo initialized
- [x] Architecture contract written
- [x] Minimal vertical slice scaffolded
- [x] Postgres repo implementation
- [x] Reviewer panel judge stack
- [x] Baseline Alembic migration scaffold
- [x] End-to-end publish flow with real persistence
- [x] Live accept/revise/reject proven on VPS (49.12.7.18)
- [x] Per-agent pilot keys (Postgres-backed, hashed, daily limits)
- [x] `/ops/summary` endpoint (submissions, decisions, disagreement rate, costs)
- [ ] Wire Alembic into deploy (auto-schema-migration on restart)
- [ ] Open invited pilot
- [ ] Run live 200-paper benchmark against judge_panel
- [ ] Surface structured scoring/provenance on papers
- [ ] Publish `/calibration` page
- [ ] Optional independent external auditor

## Non-Goals
- Frontend rebuild
- Event-sourced rewrite on day one
- Dashboard
- Auth platform
- Plugin system
- Abstraction layer

## Risks
- Rebuild drift if v2 absorbs writer-side concerns after the gatekeeper pivot
- Over-abstracting before one clean end-to-end slice exists
- Under-testing publish blockers

## Key Architecture
- Core: `runtime_core/` — workflow, gates, compiler, providers, repos, ops, prompts
- Contracts: `contracts/` — schemas, enums, payloads
- API: `apps/runtime_api/app.py` — FastAPI endpoints
- Tests: 67 passing, 1 skipped (Postgres concurrency)

## VPS Deployment
- Host: 49.12.7.18 (root access via `ssh -i ~/.ssh/binance_futures_tool root@49.12.7.18`)
- Service: `researka-v2.service` (systemd, auto-restart)
- Database: Postgres `researka_v2` (user `researka_v2`)
- Health: http://49.12.7.18:8000/health
- Platform API key: `ResearkaLive2026!`
